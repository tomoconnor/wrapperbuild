wrapperbuild
============

Something I wrote to simplify packaging stuff with fpm.

Whilst trying to package >100 vendor supplied packages, all in dubious states of sense and order, into a definitive package naming/ordering/FHS-compatible structure, I realised that the whole process can be sped up by having a system for creating the metadata for the package itself.
